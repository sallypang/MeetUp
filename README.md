# MeetUp App

<b><big>UBC CPSC 210 MeetUp's Requirement Document</b></big>

#<b>Purpose:</b>
The purpose of this android app is to meet up with a friend on campus at a certain location!
MeetUp takes in the user's school schedule and a friend's school schedule and determines when 
the user and their friends have a common break time. Then, the user can pick a certain food
location filtered by food type to meet up.

#<b>References:</b>
MeetUp uses MapQuest's API to plot the user's school schedule, showing a route from the first class to the
last class on a certain day of the week. To parse the given food locations from FourSquare, I used the Java
JSON library.
